# Office Worker's Health
Working 8 hours a day in front of a computer exposes you to specific health challenges. This guide provides community tips on improving your health as an office worker. 

If you have personal experiences that you think can help others, please create a pull request.

## Fingers, arms and shoulders

*Symptons*
* The joints in your fingers hurt.
* The area between your thumb and forefinger is red and burns.
* Your fingers and hands are cold.

*Possible solutions*
* Blood is not running freely to your hands as your arms are always lifted halfway up in the air (at keyboard level). Take a break every hour and rest your hands on your legs for 5-10 minutes. You will feel your hands being warm when resting them, and you are ready for another round of sending your most important e-mails.
* Your fingers become overloaded by being used for too many consecutive hours. If you are working daytime don't also use a keyboard in the evening. Your brain can be used for other things than just writing stuff, so figure out how you can use your time effectively other ways.
* In between writing on the keyboard you are not relaxing your fingers. They instead stay prepared and tense to be prepared for the next words/code to be written. Remove your hands from the keyboard in all the small pauses or focus on relaxing them.
* Your arms have been in the 90 degrees angle for too long (maybe many years), thus your shoulders and arms are tense. You might not feel it, but try letting your arms hang along your body and relax as much as possible in your arms and shoulders. You will soon get a feeling that you shoulders can be much more relaxed than they usually are. Make an effort every day to obtain a more relaxed position in your shoulders.
* When you lie down to sleep at night make an effort to relax your arms, as they can probably obtain a more relaxed position here as well.

## Eyes

*Symptons*
* Your eyesight are becoming worse.
* You need 1-2 seconds to refocus after removing your eyes from the monitor.
* You feel an itching around your eyes and an urge to rub your eyes with your hands.

*Possible solutions*
* You forget to blink by focusing to much on the stuff you see on the monitor. Look out the window from time to time. You will feel you eyes being more relaxed (and you might experience new ideas and energy flowing to your brain as well).
* You simply spent to much time looking at a monitor 50 cm away. Human eyes are not build for this distance. Try spending fewer hours working. After all your health are more important than work and money.
* If your eyesight is already gotten worse, you might need to see an optician to check if you need glasses or your current glasses adjusted.

## Back

*Symptons*
* The lower of your back hurts.

*Possible solutions*
* You need to change working position. Change multiple times a day between sitting on a chair, standing and maybe sitting on a fitness ball or similar.
* Use different stretch exercises multiple times a day. The effort needed is not big in the light of the gain.
